### Leverage the power of Lua

Lightroom incorporates Lua, a lightweight, powerful, and portable scripting language, for developing your plug-ins. Lightroom enhances Lua with a custom object-oriented infrastructure that gives you access to the API.

### Work with metadata

### Enhance the Lightroom UI

Build custom sections for the Plug-in Manager or Export dialogs. Display or enhance predefined dialogs and write your own custom ones. Add menu items to give users access to your custom functionality.

### Build web engine plug-ins

Create an HTML web-engine plug-in to define a new type of HTML photo gallery. Your web-engine plug-ins let you build new layouts and processing capabilities into photo galleries shared on the web.
